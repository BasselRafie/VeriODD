# VeriODD

**VeriODD** is an ANTLR-based toolchain that compiles YAML ODD/COD specifications into  
(i) human-readable *propositional logic formulas* and (ii) solver-ready *SMT-LIB* for automated verification with **Z3**.  
It supports module-level checks (consistency and COD-in-ODD) and comes with a simple GUI.
